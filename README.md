# (TOS-SAFE)Discord-AMOLED-Theme
his is a dark AMOLED theme so you can get the darkest discord possible without the need of BetterDiscord (BetterDiscord skins Break Discord TOS and you can get banned from using it)
You could either paste the script into the discord console or use tampermonkey to use the skin. Check out my greasyfork link to install it to tampermonkey https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/423585-discord-amoled-theme

UPDATE 2.0.0:
-AMOLED Black is effective in more places in the Discord API
-Sidebar Animations slide the user list and the channels list in and out when you move your mouse
